# COVID-19-Worldwide-Analysis-and-Prediction
Introduction  COVID-19 Analysis: The dataset used in this notebook (Covid-19_dataset.csv) is same as the COVID19_line_list_data.csv dataset taken from https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset, but the only difference is that in our dataset death and recovered features are encoded as (0 or 1) and not in form of dates as in the later dataset.  There are three parts to my report as follows:  -Cleaning -Visualization -Prediction. The first purpose of choosing this work is to find out which factors are more important in the death and recovery of patients.  The second purpose is implementing several machine learning algorithms to predict the death and recovery of patients and compare the result to discover which algorithm works better for this specific dataset.
